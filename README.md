# PHP Unified State

This package provides an interface for the [Stream Wrapper implementation of PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/class.streamwrapper.php).

The available interface is located in the `Common` folder together with an abstract implementation.
It is recommended to use this abstract implementation, because this will make a required property available.

The required property is `$context`, it MUST be public, because PHP sets the context of a stream on this variable.

# Registering a stream wrapper

After implementing the interface and abstract a stream wrapper can be registered.
This can be done by calling the function `stream_wrapper_register(string $protocol , string $classname [, int $flags = 0 ])`.
This function required 3 parameters:
- $protocol: The wrapper name should be passed to this variable.
- - Example: if you want to be able to call `fopen('void://path/to/my/file.txt', 'w+')`, you should pass `'void'` to this parameter.
- $classname: This should be name of the class which handles (read: implements StreamWrapperInterface) the stream.
- - Example: to register the `VoidStreamWrapper` you should pass `\PhpUnified\StreamWrapper\VoidStreamWrapper::class` to this parameter.
- $flags: This parameter expects an integer, either `STREAM_IS_URL` (for a HTTP stream) or `0` (for a local stream, this is the default).
